# CSCI-115 Term Project

This C++ program allows users to test the brute-force approach and dynamic approach that we have created
to find pairs in a set that add up to a target value.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler
- Visual Studios is recommended
- The following files are required:
"Part2_pairs.cpp"

## Usage
1. User can modify the set and target values in the main function.
2. Run the program.
3. Console will display "Pair Not Found" or "Pair Found" depending on if a pair was found in the set that adds up to the target value.

### Note
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler and the STL (Standard Template Library) installed.
